# Melanoma Lesion Carcinogenic Classification Analysis
The aim is to create the most precise accurate ML model by studying possible ramifications of past pre-trained networks and fine-tune them.
There are two objectives for this project:
1. To compare statistical accuracy of different combinations of possible pre-trained models + various classifying algorithms. Another internal objective is to include feature extraction and perform transfer learning as well.
2. To include texture extraction and include textures as layers in the custom prepared CNN to create a very high accuracy model with ISIC approved large dataset.

## Objective I:
### Comparing statistical accuracy of pre-trained model + classifying algorithm 
Here we observe results of various pre trained models or classifying algorithms on its own.
- SVM - 76.84%
- ResNet - 80.99%
- Inception
- VGG
- ResNet + VGG16
